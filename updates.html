<h1>News & Updates</h1>
<p>2.21.2018 - Didn't get to do much today, just fixed a few things with the wine list and changed the formula for determining the prices, still think it's not quite right, but it's close enough for now.</p>
<p>2.20.2018 - Started working on the drinks. Did a lot of work on the backend so that several aspects are now based on the quality of the tavern. Wines are <i>mostly</i> done, still need to do the beers and hard alcohols. Then I'll move onto the foodstuffs, and then work on other details that will get added back in to the other sections.</p>
<p>2.19.2018 - Worked a lot on the Tavern Generator. It now generates bartenders and clientele, including patron activities and a few adventure hooks. Also broke up the functions to make it easier and then that allowed me to add individual buttons to allow for rerolling just parts of the tavern. It's coming along pretty well.</p>
<p>2.18.2018 - Worked more on the Tavern Generator. Added more possibilities and changed how a few things were being figured out. Should be even easier to add new things in the future now. Also, I should really set this update page up like a wordpress thing so it doesn't eventually become just one huge long page of updates...</p>
<p>2.17.2018 - Worked a bit on the Tavern Generator, mostly cleaning up the formulas to make things easier in the future. Added automated math to show how many possibilities there are. Also added more possibilities.</p>
<p>2.14.18 - Added an actual adventures page instead of just linking to my DM's Guild author page. Still need to make it actually work properly, right now it's wonky, but hey, I'm reteaching myself HTML after not really doing much with it for a long time.</p>
<p>2.13.18 - The alpha version of the website is up with a very sparse tavern generator included. <a href="bit.ly/OS-LoveBites">Love Bites</a> has over 200 downloads and is still pay-what-you-want for Valentine's Day. Pick it up and surprise your significant other with an adventure of love! The traveler generator will be along soon<sup style='font-size:5pt'>TM</sup>. Dirge's D&D Dollar Dreadfuls, a series of loosely connected short adventures, is in production and the first one will be out in the Spring. Several other projects are on the backburner; more details will get pushed out about those once everything solidifies a bit more.</p>
